# Upgrade notices

All upgrade notices (hotfix releases) will be documented here. Use the buggy versions at your own risks.

## v2.2.1

Fix an escaping error introduced in the 2.0.0 version. If you tried to use HTML inside Dynamic Content shortcode, the HTML code is escaped so it became unusable.

## v2.0.4

Fix a bug introduced in the 2.0.2 version, you must upgrade asap because the async attribute on form generator script blocks `document.write`.

## v2.0.3

Fix a bug introduced in the 2.0.2 version, you must upgrade asap because there was a typo in the option page name which forbid option to be saved.
